### **Analysis**
- For the drug regimens, it seems that the mice treated with Capomulin and Ramicane were treated more times than the other treatments. 

- The mice trials were well-balnaced by gender.

- The biggest takeaway seems to be that the mice treated with Capomulin and Ramicane had much smaller final tumor volumes at the last timepoint. This is good evidence for these two drugs being the most effective at reducing the size of tumors in mice.

- Further evidence of the effectiveness of Capomulin can be seen when graphing tumor volume over time in the trial for a single mouse. I used the mouse ID of "l509" and at about halfway through the trial (about day 22) this mouse's tumor began to shrink at a fast rate. 

- One complication to the use of overall tumor size is that when we use a scatterplot and correlation to look at the relationship between average tumor size and the weight of the mice, there is a strong linear relationship, the bigger the mouse the larger the tumor. The correlation coefficient was 0.84, which is quite high.

- Therefore, when looking at tumor size as the criteria for success of these drugs it would be better to take the overall difference in the size of the tumor before and after treatment for each mouse. This would be a better statistical approach to evaluating the effectiveness of these drugs on reducing tumor size.
